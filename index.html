    <h2>PORTFOLIO</h2>
    <p> There is great thanks in the development of the world from various aspects at the present time, both at the
        industrial and commercial level to the various vehicles and transportation that are used these days, and its
        continuous development .

        Cars and means of transportation have not been invented in the past between day and night; as we can not return
        the invention of cars to one person only, as in all inventions and discoveries as well; science and geometry are
        generally considered cumulative, in which each scientist is completed beyond his predecessors so as to
        eventually obtain a particular invention or discovery. The history of the first steam car dates back to 1769 when
        Nicholas Joseph Kignot invented the first steam-powered car on full scale, In 1801 Joseph Trevethick also designed
        a four-wheeled steam engine. After that, the steam engines were continuously developed and the various systems used
        were improved, Until 1885, Karl Baines developed the first gasoline-fueled internal combustion engine, which is still
        in use today in cars, and has patented it. Later, in 1896, Henry Ford manufactured the first four-wheel gasoline-powered
        vehicle; the first air-pressure tires were manufactured in the previous year and were manufactured by Mechelen.
        Since then, the automotive industry has witnessed a very large development; many different designs have been
        made for cars.

        At present, in the 20th and 21st centuries, electric cars has been invented in addition to and hybrid cars which
        powered by fuel and electricity.The first hybrid car manufactured by Ferdinand Porsche was in 1901.
