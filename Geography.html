    <h1 class="inline"> GEOGRAPHY OF INDIA</h1>
    <P>
            India lies on the Indian Plate, the northern portion of the Indo-Australian Plate, whose continental crust forms
        the Indian subcontinent. The country is situated north of the equator between 8°04' to 37°06' north latitude and
        68°07' to 97°25' east longitude. It is the seventh-largest country in the world, with a total area of
        3,287,263 square kilometres (1,269,219 sq mi). India measures 3,214 km (1,997 mi) from north to south and
        2,933 km (1,822 mi) from east to west. It has a land frontier of 15,200 km (9,445 mi) and a coastline of 7,516.6
        km (4,671 mi).

            On the south, India projects into and is bounded by the Indian Ocean—in particular, by the Arabian Sea on the
        west, the Lakshadweep Sea to the southwest, the Bay of Bengal on the east, and the Indian Ocean proper to the
        south. The Palk Strait and Gulf of Mannar separate India from Sri Lanka to its immediate southeast, and the
        Maldives are some 125 kilometres (78 mi) to the south of India's Lakshadweep Islands across the Eight Degree
        Channel. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands, some 1,200 kilometres (750 mi) southeast of the mainland, share
        maritime borders with Myanmar, Thailand and Indonesia. Kanyakumari at 8°4′41″N and 77°55′230″E is the
        southernmost tip of the Indian mainland, while the southernmost point in India is Indira Point on Great Nicobar
        Island. The northernmost point which is under Indian administration is Indira Col, Siachen Glacier. India's
        territorial waters extend into the sea to a distance of 12 nautical miles (13.8 mi; 22.2 km) from the coast
        baseline. India has the 18th largest Exclusive Economic Zone of 2,305,143 km2 (890,021 sq mi).

            The northern frontiers of India are defined largely by the Himalayan mountain range, where the country borders
        China, Bhutan, and Nepal. Its western border with Pakistan lies in the Karakoram range, Punjab Plains, the Thar
        Desert and the Rann of Kutch salt marshes. In the far northeast, the Chin Hills and Kachin Hills, deeply
        forested mountainous regions, separate India from Burma. On the east, its border with Bangladesh is largely
        defined by the Khasi Hills and Mizo Hills, and the watershed region of the Indo-Gangetic Plain.

        The Ganga is the longest river originating in India. The Ganga–Brahmaputra system occupies most of northern,
        central, and eastern India, while the Deccan Plateau occupies most of southern India. Kangchenjunga, in the
        Indian state of Sikkim, is the highest point in India at 8,586 m (28,169 ft) and the world's third highest peak.
        Climate across India ranges from equatorial in the far south, to alpine and tundra in the upper reaches of the
        Himalayas. the geographic view of India is pretty expository and vivid in the terms of area, mountains and
        relief.
