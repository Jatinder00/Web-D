    <h1 class="inline"> GEOGRAPHY OF INDIA</h1>


    <P>
        India lies on the Indian Plate, the northern portion of the Indo-Australian Plate, whose continental crust forms
        the Indian subcontinent. The country is situated north of the equator between 8°04' to 37°06' north latitude and
        68°07' to 97°25' east longitude. It is the seventh-largest country in the world, with a total area of
        3,287,263 square kilometres (1,269,219 sq mi). India measures 3,214 km (1,997 mi) from north to south and
        2,933 km (1,822 mi) from east to west. It has a land frontier of 15,200 km (9,445 mi) and a coastline of 7,516.6
        km (4,671 mi).

        On the south, India projects into and is bounded by the Indian Ocean—in particular, by the Arabian Sea on the
        west, the Lakshadweep Sea to the southwest, the Bay of Bengal on the east, and the Indian Ocean proper to the
        south. The Palk Strait and Gulf of Mannar separate India from Sri Lanka to its immediate southeast, and the
        Maldives are some 125 kilometres (78 mi) to the south of India's Lakshadweep Islands across the Eight Degree
        Channel. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands, some 1,200 kilometres (750 mi) southeast of the mainland, share
        maritime borders with Myanmar, Thailand and Indonesia. Kanyakumari at 8°4′41″N and 77°55′230″E is the
        southernmost tip of the Indian mainland, while the southernmost point in India is Indira Point on Great Nicobar
        Island. The northernmost point which is under Indian administration is Indira Col, Siachen Glacier. India's
        territorial waters extend into the sea to a distance of 12 nautical miles (13.8 mi; 22.2 km) from the coast
        baseline. India has the 18th largest Exclusive Economic Zone of 2,305,143 km2 (890,021 sq mi).

        The northern frontiers of India are defined largely by the Himalayan mountain range, where the country borders
        China, Bhutan, and Nepal. Its western border with Pakistan lies in the Karakoram range, Punjab Plains, the Thar
        Desert and the Rann of Kutch salt marshes. In the far northeast, the Chin Hills and Kachin Hills, deeply
        forested mountainous regions, separate India from Burma. On the east, its border with Bangladesh is largely
        defined by the Khasi Hills and Mizo Hills, and the watershed region of the Indo-Gangetic Plain.

        The Ganga is the longest river originating in India. The Ganga–Brahmaputra system occupies most of northern,
        central, and eastern India, while the Deccan Plateau occupies most of southern India. Kangchenjunga, in the
        Indian state of Sikkim, is the highest point in India at 8,586 m (28,169 ft) and the world's third highest peak.
        Climate across India ranges from equatorial in the far south, to alpine and tundra in the upper reaches of the
        Himalayas. the geographic view of India is pretty expository and vivid in the terms of area, mountains and
        relief.India is situated entirely on the Indian Plate, a major tectonic plate that was formed when it split off
        from the ancient continent Gondwanaland (ancient landmass, consisting of the southern part of the supercontinent
        of Pangea). The Indo-Australian plate is subdivided into the Indian and Australian plates. About 90 million
        years ago, during the late Cretaceous Period, the Indian Plate began moving north at about 15 cm/year (6
        in/yr). About 50 to 55 million years ago, in the Eocene Epoch of the Cenozoic Era, the plate collided with
        Asia after covering a distance of 2,000 to 3,000 km (1,243 to 1,864 mi), having moved faster than any other
        known plate. In 2007, German geologists determined that the Indian Plate was able to move so quickly because it
        is only half as thick as the other plates which formerly constituted Gondwanaland. The collision with the
        Eurasian Plate along the modern border between India and Nepal formed the orogenic belt that created the Tibetan
        Plateau and the Himalayas. As of 2009, the Indian Plate is moving northeast at 5 cm/yr (2 in/yr), while the
        Eurasian Plate is moving north at only 2 cm/yr (0.8 in/yr). India is thus referred to as the "fastest
        continent". This is causing the Eurasian Plate to deform, and the Indian Plate to compress at a rate of 4
        cm/yr (1.6 in/yr).

    <h2 class="inline">CLIMATE</h2>
    <p>
        Based on the Köppen system, India hosts six major climatic subtypes, ranging from arid desert in the west,
        alpine tundra and glaciers in the north, and humid tropical regions supporting rainforests in the southwest and
        the island territories. The nation has four seasons: winter (January–February), summer (March–May), a monsoon
        (rainy) season (June–September) and a post-monsoon period (October–December). The Himalayas act as a barrier to
        the frigid katabatic winds flowing down from Central Asia. Thus, northern India is kept warm or only mildly
        cooled during winter; in summer, the same phenomenon makes India relatively hot. Although the Tropic of Cancer—the
        boundary between the tropics and subtropics—passes through the middle of India, the whole country is considered to be
        tropical. Summer lasts between March and June in most parts of India. Temperatures can exceed 40 °C (104 °F) during the
        day. The coastal regions exceed 30 °C (86 °F) coupled with high levels of humidity. In the Thar desert area
        temperatures can exceed 45 °C (113 °F). The rain-bearing monsoon clouds are attracted to the low-pressure system
        created by the Thar Desert. The southwest monsoon splits into two arms, the Bay of Bengal arm and the Arabian
        Sea arm. The Bay of Bengal arm moves northwards crossing northeast India in early June. The Arabian Sea arm
        moves northwards and deposits much of its rain on the windward side of Western Ghats. Winters in peninsula India
        see mild to warm days and cool nights. Further north the temperature is cooler. Temperatures in some parts of
        the Indian plains sometimes fall below freezing. Most of northern India is plagued by fog during this season.
        The highest temperature recorded in India was 51 °C (124 °F) in Phalodi, Rajasthan. The lowest was −45 °C (−49
        °F) in Kashmir.
